Multi-Criteria Convergence with Custom Operators
=================================================

:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.ConvergenceHook` detects when geometry
optimisation or MD has reached a desired stopping condition and removes
converged systems from the active batch so subsequent steps spend compute only
on unconverged systems.

A convergence hook holds a list of **criteria**, each of which evaluates a
tensor attribute of the batch and returns a per-system boolean.  A system is
declared converged when **every** criterion is satisfied simultaneously.  This
AND-logic prevents false positives: a system with near-zero forces but still
large energy fluctuations is not yet converged.

Key concepts demonstrated
--------------------------
* ``ConvergenceHook.from_forces(threshold)`` — the simplest one-liner.
* Multi-criteria convergence combining force norm **and** a second criterion.
* ``custom_op`` — a callable that receives the raw tensor and returns a ``[B]``
  bool mask, used here to implement an energy-change criterion.
* Combining force-norm and energy-change criteria in a FIRE optimisation.

# Built-in convergence: from_forces factory
# -------------------------------------------
# ``ConvergenceHook.from_forces(threshold)`` is the standard one-liner for
# geometry optimisation.  It reads the ``"forces"`` key from the batch,
# computes the per-atom Euclidean norm, takes the max over atoms within each
# graph (scatter reduce), and declares convergence when that max norm ≤
# *threshold*.

# Multi-criteria convergence
# ---------------------------
# Pass a list of criterion dicts.  Each dict maps to a
# :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base._ConvergenceCriterion`.
#
# ``reduce_op="norm"`` computes the per-atom vector norm along ``reduce_dims=-1``
# (last axis = Cartesian), yielding a ``[N]`` scalar per atom.
# The criterion then scatter-reduces to graph level via max before comparing to
# ``threshold``.
#
# You can add as many criteria as you like; all must be satisfied.

# Custom operator: energy-change criterion
# -----------------------------------------
# Built-in ``reduce_op`` values cover many cases, but sometimes you need
# arbitrary logic.  ``custom_op`` receives the raw tensor for that key
# (whatever shape the batch stores it in) and must return a ``[B]`` bool
# tensor.
#
# Here we implement a **relative energy-change** criterion: a system is
# converged when :math:`|\Delta E / E| < \varepsilon` between consecutive steps.  This requires
# state — we track the previous energy in a closure.
#
# The ``custom_op`` callable is called with the full ``batch.energy``
# tensor of shape ``[B, 1]``.

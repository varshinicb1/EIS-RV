Distributed Multi-GPU Pipeline: Parallel FIRE → Langevin
=========================================================

This example orchestrates two independent FIRE → NVTLangevin pipelines
running in parallel across 4 GPUs using
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DistributedPipeline`.

   :caption: Two independent FIRE → Langevin pipelines across 4 GPUs.

   }

Each FIRE rank draws molecules from a dataset, optimises them until
convergence, and sends them to the paired Langevin rank for short MD
production.  A :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.ConvergedSnapshotHook`
on the Langevin ranks writes completed trajectories to a
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.HostMemory` sink.

.. note::

    This example requires 4 GPUs.  Run with::

        torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 examples/distributed/01_distributed_pipeline.py

    For CPU-only testing, change ``backend="nccl"`` to ``backend="gloo"``.

# %%
# DistributedPipeline topology
# ----------------------------------
# :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.DistributedPipeline` maps integer GPU ranks
# to dynamics stage instances.  When ``pipeline.run()`` is called, each
# process (launched by ``torchrun``) looks up its own rank and executes
# only the corresponding stage.  Inter-rank communication is handled
# transparently via NCCL ``isend``/``irecv`` calls.
#
# Here we create two independent sub-pipelines: ranks 0→1 and 2→3.
# Each sub-pipeline is a FIRE optimiser feeding into a Langevin MD stage.
# The ``stages`` dict is built on every rank but only the local stage is
# ever executed; constructing all stages on every rank keeps the code
# identical across processes, which simplifies debugging.

# %%
# Dataset and samplers
# -------------------------
# :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.SizeAwareSampler` draws molecules from a
# dataset and packs them into variable-size batches that fit within atom
# and edge count budgets.  In a distributed setting, each upstream rank
# owns its own sampler and dataset partition so that work is distributed
# evenly.  Downstream ranks (the Langevin stages) do not need a sampler —
# they receive systems directly from the paired FIRE rank via NCCL.


# %%
# BufferConfig: fixed-size communication
# -------------------------------------------
# NCCL requires that every ``isend``/``irecv`` pair transfers an identical
# number of bytes.  :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BufferConfig` specifies
# the fixed sizes (``num_systems``, ``num_nodes``, ``num_edges``) used to
# pre-allocate communication buffers on both sender and receiver.  Choose
# values that are at least as large as the largest batch you expect to send
# in a single step; excess capacity is padded with zeros and stripped on
# receipt.

# %%
# Stage construction
# -----------------------
# Each stage is wired to its neighbours via ``prior_rank`` and ``next_rank``.
# An upstream stage has ``prior_rank=None`` and ``next_rank=<downstream>``;
# a downstream stage has ``prior_rank=<upstream>`` and ``next_rank=None``.
# The ``buffer_config`` must be identical for all stages that communicate
# with each other.

# Running the pipeline
# -------------------------

# (``dist.init_process_group``) and assigns each rank its GPU device.
# On ``__exit__`` it tears down the process group gracefully.
#
# ``pipeline.run()`` blocks until the local stage signals completion
# (``dynamics.done = True``).  Upstream ranks finish when their sampler
# is exhausted; downstream ranks finish via ``DownstreamDoneHook`` after
# a configurable number of idle steps with no incoming systems.

Canonical (NVT) Molecular Dynamics with Langevin Thermostat
============================================================

The **NVT ensemble** (constant Number of atoms, Volume, and Temperature)
samples the canonical distribution.  A thermostat couples the system to a
heat bath, injecting or removing kinetic energy to maintain the target
temperature.

:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.NVTLangevin` implements the **BAOAB** Langevin
splitting scheme, which has favourable configurational accuracy properties
compared to other Langevin splittings at the same timestep
(Leimkuhler & Matthews 2013).  The Langevin equation adds a friction
term and a random force to Newton's equations:

    m·a = F_conservative − γ·m·v + √(2·γ·m·kT) · ξ(t)

where γ is the friction coefficient (1/time) and ξ is Gaussian white noise.
Larger γ couples more strongly to the bath (faster thermalization, shorter
correlation times); smaller γ gives more NVE-like dynamics.

This example:

* Builds a small argon cluster (no periodic boundaries) on a slightly
  expanded simple-cubic lattice so atoms start near their equilibrium
  separations.  A cold start at ≈ 5 K lets the thermostat visibly supply
  energy to reach the 50 K target.
* Runs 500 NVT steps at a target of 50 K, showing the system thermalize.
* Computes the instantaneous temperature from velocities after the run.
* Demonstrates the ``"custom"`` backend of
  :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.LoggingHook` by routing each logged
  row to ``loguru.logger.info``.
* Optionally plots temperature vs step (set ``NVALCHEMI_PLOT=1``).

.. note::

    Periodic-boundary NVE energy conservation is demonstrated in
    ``04_nve_energy_conservation.py``.  This example intentionally omits
    ``pbc`` and :class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.WrapPeriodicHook` to keep
    the focus on Langevin thermalization rather than periodic geometry.

# LJ model and argon cluster
# ---------------------------
# Same Lennard-Jones argon parameters as the previous examples.  We build a
# 3×3×3 argon *cluster* (no periodic boundaries) on a slightly expanded
# simple-cubic lattice.  Spacing at 1.1×r_min keeps each atom close to its
# pair equilibrium while leaving enough room for the cluster to breathe.
#
# A simple-cubic lattice under LJ forces is mechanically unstable (the
# thermodynamically stable Ar crystal is FCC).  Omitting periodic boundaries
# avoids the rapid lattice disordering that would overwhelm the thermostat
# in a periodic-SC setup.  The WrapPeriodicHook and periodic-cell NVE are
# demonstrated in the preceding example (04_nve_energy_conservation.py).
#
# Atoms start almost at rest (cold start at T ≈ 5 K) so the thermostat has
# to supply energy to bring the system up to the 50 K target.

# NVTLangevin integrator and hooks
# ----------------------------------
# Key NVTLangevin arguments:
#
# * ``dt``          — timestep in fs.  0.5 fs keeps the integration stable
#   for LJ argon across the broad force range encountered during
#   thermalization.
# * ``temperature`` — target temperature in Kelvin
# * ``friction``    — Langevin friction γ in 1/fs.  Here γ = 0.5 fs⁻¹ gives
#   strong coupling to the heat bath: the thermostat velocity-correlation
#   timescale is 1/γ = 2 fs (4 steps at dt=0.5 fs), so the cold cluster
#   heats to the 50 K target within the first few tens of steps.
#   A weaker γ (e.g. 0.05 fs⁻¹) gives more NVE-like dynamics with longer
#   correlation times but requires more steps to thermalize a cold start.
# * ``random_seed`` — reproducible stochastic forces
#
# :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks.LoggingHook` supports a ``"custom"``
# backend that calls a user-supplied ``writer_fn(step, rows)`` on a
# background thread — the same async machinery used by the CSV backend.
# Here we route each row to ``loguru.logger.info``, which lets users plug
# in any loguru sink (rotating files, structured JSON, remote services, …).
#
# The ``writer_fn`` is called with:
#
# * ``step`` — the current step count (int)
# * ``rows`` — a list of dicts, one per graph, with keys ``step``,
#   ``graph_idx``, ``status``, ``energy``, ``fmax``, ``temperature``
#
# We also accumulate temperature into ``_temp_history`` for the optional
# plot, since the custom backend does not write a file.
